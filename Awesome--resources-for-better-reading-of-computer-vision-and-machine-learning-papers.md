## Awesome  resources for better reading of computer vision and machine learning paper

#### Are you starting a PhD in deep-learning-based computer vision ?

<details> <summary> Fast and efficient paper reading is critical for your PhD success</summary>

- A PhD can be a race against time (you have to stay up-to-date with recent publications, you have to match state of the art results which is getting more and more competitive as time goes, and you have to finish writing your thesis before your funding runs out!)
- Your reading has to be as efficient as can be, some tools can help you with that !

## Reading resources : Keeping up with our quickly evolving field

<details open> <summary> <a href="http://www.arxiv-sanity.com"><b>arxiv sanity</b></a>: A nice wrapper over <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arxiv</a> to search for recent machine learning and vision papers </summary> 

#### Pros: 

- easy query of papers with the research tool using keywords, author names, ...
- allows you to save papers in a virtual library for future reading
- good [top recent](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/top?timefilter=month&vfilter=all) functionality based on what people put into their library (which I found a more reliable metric then [hype](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/toptwtr?timefilter=month) which is based on tweets

#### Cons:
- only covers the last three years, so only useful to find recent papers

<details><summary><a href="https://github.com/jnv/lists"><b>awesome paper lists on github </b> </a>: Lists of "awesome" papers and resources specific to a subject</summary>

#### Pros:
- Exist on a large variety of topics, and at different granularitiees, don't know where to start ? Try a [search on github](https://github.com/search?q=awesome+lists) with `awesome list` and some additional keywords
- Can allow you to painlessly keep-up with papers of a very specific subfield (as in the [hand-pose-estimation case](https://github.com/xinghaochen/awesome-hand-pose-estimation))
- For some examples checkout [awesomep-deep-vision](https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-deep-vision) and [awesome-computer-vision](https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision#readme)  

 
#### Cons:

- No guarantees (might not be actively maintained)
- No standardized format (can be ordered according to time, popularity, ...)
- Might not exist for your specific sub-domain of interest (for instance, I couldn't find a body-pose awesome list), this is the opportunity to create one ! It will surely benefit the community.

<summary><a href="https://github.com/aleju/papers"><b>Aleju's papers</b></a>: Alexander Jung's paper summaries of a large number of popular deep learning papers, understand many popular deep learning papers in a fraction of the full paper's reading time </summary>

#### Pros:

- Covers a **lot** of papers, probably any fundation paper of deep learning ([batch-norm](https://github.com/aleju/papers/blob/00738fd38435e224aa10c04421e6abea199b92a6/neural-nets/Batch_Normalization.md), [adam](https://github.com/aleju/papers/blob/00738fd38435e224aa10c04421e6abea199b92a6/neural-nets/Adam.md), ...), a lot of widely-used papers ([Mask-RCNN](https://github.com/aleju/papers/blob/3d0fe44ad55e143390bd298dfd1d5c6050a5bcca/neural-nets/Mask_R-CNN.md), [Cycle-GAN](https://github.com/aleju/papers/blob/6873ee03a24b2ab08fae20eeeb323ae06511b969/neural-nets/Unsupervised_Image-to-Image_Translation_Networks.md), ...)
- If you want to understand some hype or widely used paper, chances you will find it there, and if you find it it will help you understand the general ideas as well as the implementation details

#### Cons:
- Of course, as this effort mainly relies on the effort of one (very productive) person, not *all* papers are available in this cheat-sheet format

<details><summary><a href="https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/"><b>arxiv vanity</b></a>: A tool to read arxiv papers in your browser, useful to read papers on your smartphone ! </summary>

#### Pros:
- Simple interface which converts arxiv papers to webpages for easy scrolling

#### Cons:
- Good reading, but nothing more, as there are no easy tools to annotate the paper on your smartphone directly
