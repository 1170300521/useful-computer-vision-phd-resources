#### What to Look For

> **Minor flaws** can be corrected and **shouldn't be a reason to reject a paper**

> **Embrace novel, brave concepts**

> The fact that a proposed method does **not exceed the state of the art accuracy on an existing benchmark dataset is not grounds for rejection by itself**.

> Acceptance and rejection decisions should not be determined solely by the method's raw performance

> It is important to **weigh both the novelty and potential impact of the work alongside the reported performance**

> Each paper that is accepted should be **technically sound** and **make a contribution to the field**.

> The best way to write a paper is to first give a talk on it

> Introduction section: The most important section of a paper. For me, once I have finished reading the introduction, I have formed an opinion of whether to accept or reject the paper

> I can’t stand “future work” sections. It’s hard to think of a weaker way to end a paper

> Omit needless words

> Figure captions should be self-contained and the caption should tell the reader what to notice about the figure

> There are perceived pressures to over-sell, hide drawbacks, and disparage others’ work.  Don’t succumb.
