<details open><summary>Motivation</summary>

Having started a PhD in 2017, I progressively stumbled upon **talks/tools/advice** that **I wish I had come accross earlier**.
I will keep adding links and material as I find them, feel free to suggest some as [pull requests](https://github.com/hassony2/useful-computer-vision-phd-resources/pulls) or [issues](https://github.com/hassony2/useful-computer-vision-phd-resources/issues) !

I want to write efficiently so that you can have an **overview of the tools/resources in less then a minute** and so that you can **easily find the original source/link to the resource**.

In drop-downs below some resources I will **provide short summaries** of the advice when relevant, often as a **list of quotes from the original resource**.

Towards this purpose I will extensively use drop-down extensions.
