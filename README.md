<details open><summary>Motivation</summary>
Having started a PhD one year ago I progressively stumbled upon talks/tools/advice that I wish I had come accross earlier.
I will keep adding links and material as I find new resources that I find useful.

My goal is to write efficiently so that you can easily find the original source/link to the resource, as well as provide short summaries when relevant.
Towards this purpose I will extensively use drop-down extensions.
