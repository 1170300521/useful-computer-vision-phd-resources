Jordi Pont-Tuset:
  
- check papers right when assigned to prevent discovering problems which request area-chair intervention at the last minute 
- read paper & mark comments
- group comments by topic
- **didactically** write down comments about each group, assuming minimal background knowledge

Fatma GÃ¼ney:
- Critical thinking: question, doubt, clarify your questions
- Constructive input: Explain what is missing, provide suggestions for inprovement, specific & detailed
- Empathy: Respect the work, proper, ideally encouraging language
  
Conrad Schindler:
- Novelty: remember that new ideas are **rare**, better questions are "would this be of interest to the people attending the conference/reading the journal", "Does the work contribute to advancing the domain"
